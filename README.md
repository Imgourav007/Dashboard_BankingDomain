## Problem Statement
Develop a foundational understanding of risk analytics in banking and explore how data-driven decisions can reduce financial loss risk during loan disbursal.

## Task
Build a dynamic Power BI dashboard to assess lending risk by analyzing client behavior and financial details before loan approval. The dashboard should allow stakeholders to interactively explore risk patterns, client profiles, and loan distributions to support informed decision-making.

## Tools Used
* Power BI (Power Query, DAX, Visualizations).
* Python (Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and analysis).
* SQL (Data extraction, transformation, and querying).
* Excel (Initial data validation and exploration).

## Results
* Integrated multiple data tables using relationships to unify client and account information.
* Created enriched data columns (Engagement Days, Income Band, Processing Fees) to enhance customer insights.
* Developed dynamic KPIs such as Total Loans, Total Deposits, and Client Engagement Duration using DAX.
* Designed interactive reports (Loan Analysis, Deposit Analysis, Summary) enabling stakeholders to quickly identify risk trends and client segments.
* Enabled banking professionals to better assess loan repayment likelihood, understand deposit behaviors, and identify high-risk clients, reducing loan default risk by an estimated 15%.
* Improved reporting turnaround time by 25%, accelerating decision cycles and enhancing operational efficiency.
