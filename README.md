## Problem Statement
To develop a foundational understanding of risk analytics in banking and explore how data-driven decisions can reduce the risk of financial loss during loan disbursal.

## Solution
To address the challenge of assessing lending risk, this Power BI dashboard was developed to help banks analyze client behavior and financial details before approving loans.
The solution leverages Power BI's advanced data modeling, transformation, and visualization features to create a user-friendly and insightful dashboard for decision-makers in the banking sector.

## Key Aspects of the Solution:
1. Data Integration: Combined multiple interrelated tables using relationships (primary and foreign keys) to unify client, account, and banking relationship data.

2. Data Cleaning & Enrichment: Added new columns like Engagement Days, Income Band, and Processing Fees to provide deeper insights into customer behavior and risk categorization.

3. Dynamic Metrics with DAX: Used DAX functions such as SUMX, DISTINCTCOUNT, and DATEDIFF to derive meaningful KPIs like Total Loans, Total Deposits, and Client Engagement Duration.

4. Interactive Dashboards: Designed a set of interactive reports (Loan Analysis, Deposit Analysis, Summary Dashboard) to help stakeholders quickly identify risk patterns and opportunities.

Business Value:
Empowers banking professionals to:
a. Assess whether an applicant is likely to repay a loan.
b. Understand deposit behaviors across account types.
c. Identify clients with high engagement or high-risk profiles.
d. Evaluate loan distribution by gender, advisor, or nationality.
